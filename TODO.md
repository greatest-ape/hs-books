# Important
  - Add loading screen

# Not important
  - Make cover image files writeable by everyone?
  - Improve image saving error management (catch more specific errors)
  - Add a last-resort path search for all image files named something like
    cover, if no cover if found by other means. This is probably not necessary
    to implement
  - Use some kind of hashing for cover filenames?
  - Send only one title and one creator (possibly in both name forms)
  - Send one date and one publisher as maybe?
