# Important
  - Mobile device styles

# Not important
  - Improve image saving error management (catch more specific errors)
  - Add a last-resort path search for all image files named something like
    cover, if no cover if found by other means. This is probably not necessary
    to implement
  - Use some kind of hashing for cover filenames?
