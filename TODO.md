# Important
  - Generate small jpegs for all covers; if already saved, don't generate;
    name after filename or possibly some kind of hash
  - Send only one title and one creator (possibly in both name forms)
  - Send one date and one publisher as maybe?
  
# Not important
  - Add a last-resort path search for all image files named something like
    cover, if no cover if found by other means. This is probably not necessary
    to implement
